Like oratory, music, dance, calligraphy - like anything that lends
its grace to language - typography is an art that can be deliberately
misused. It is a craft by which the meanings of a text (or its absence
of meaning) can be clarified, honored and shared, or knowingly
disguised.
</p><br>
<p>
In a world rife with unsolicited messages, typography must
often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to
be read, it must relinquish the attention it has drawn. Typography
with anything to say therefore aspires to a kind of statuesque
transparency. Its other traditional goal is durability: not immunity
to change, but a clear superiority to fashion. Typography at its best
is a visual form of language linking timelessness and time.
One of the principles of durable typography is always leg-
ibility; another is something more than legibility: some earned or
unearned interest that gives its living energy to the page. It takes
various forms and goes by various names, including serenity,
liveliness, laughter, grace and joy.
</p><br>
<p>
These principles apply, in different ways, to the typography of
business cards, instruction sheets and postage stamps, as well as
to editions of religious scriptures, literary classics and other books
that aspire to join their ranks. Within limits, the same principles
apply even to stock market reports, airline schedules, milk cartons,
classified ads. But laughter, grace and joy, like legibility itself, all
feed on meaning, which the writer, the words and the subject, not
the typographer, must generally provide.

Literary style, says Walter Benjamin, "is the power to move freely
in the length and breadth of linguistic thinking without slipping
into banality." Typographic style, in this large and intelligent sense
of the word, does not mean any particular style - my style or your
style, or Neoclassical or Baroque style - but the power to move
freely through the whole domain of typography, and to function
at every step in a way that is graceful and vital instead of banal. It
means typography that can walk familiar ground without sliding
into platitudes, typography that responds to new conditions with
innovative solutions, and typography that does not vex the reader
with its own originality in a self-conscious search for praise.

Typography is to literature as musical performance is to
composition: an essential act of interpretation, full of endless
opportunities for insight or obtuseness. Much typography is far
ien10ved from literature, for language has many uses, includ-
ing packaging and propaganda. Like music, it can be used to
manipulate behavior and emotions. But this is not where typog-
raphers, musicians or other human beings show us their finest
side. Typography at its best is a slow performing art, worthy of the
same informed appreciation that we sometimes give to musical
performances, and capable of giving similar nourishment and
pleasure in return.

The same alphabets and page designs can be used for a bi-
ography of Mohandas Gandhi and for a manual on the use and
deployment of biological weapons. Writing can be used both for
love letters and for hate mail, and love letters themselves can be
used for manipulation and extortion as well as to bring delight
to body and soul. Evidently there is nothing inherently noble
and trustworthy in the written or printed word.
